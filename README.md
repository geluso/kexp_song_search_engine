# kexp_song_search_engine
KSSE: KEXP Song Search Engine. Search through the entire history of KEXP radio.

This project scrapes the online KEXP hourly playlist and builds a database recording
what songs are played at what time. The project consists of a scraper, parser, and database tool.
Each component of the project is configured to behave like a command line tool and act independantly.
